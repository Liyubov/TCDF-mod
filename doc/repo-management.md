## Issues

Any task should be created through issue tracker and assigned to a `Task: complexity` label. Doing this will connect project board with code and repo directly and will help backtracking changes. 


## Branches

Create new branch to add new features, fix bugs or anything else:
```bash
git checkout -b branch_name
```
